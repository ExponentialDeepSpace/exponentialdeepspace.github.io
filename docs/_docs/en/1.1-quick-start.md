## Installing the Theme

### Common Method

To install it with common method, all you need to do is copying all the theme files to your project. There are several ways to do so:

1. Clone [jekyll-TeXt-theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) from github:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme.git
   ```

1. Download and unzip the file to your Jekyll site directory.

1. If you host your site on GitHub Pages, you can just fork [jekyll-TeXt-theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme), then rename the repository to **USERNAME.github.io** — replacing **USERNAME** with your GitHub username.

### Ruby Gem Method

1. Add this line to your Jekyll site’s *Gemfile*:

   ```ruby
   gem "jekyll-text-theme"
   ```

1. Add this line to your Jekyll site’s *_config.yml* file:

   ```yaml
   theme: jekyll-text-theme
   ```

1. Then run Bundler to install the theme gem and dependencies:

   ```bash
   $ bundle install
   ```

## Setup Your Site

If you install the theme with common method, you can go straight to the next step. But **if you install the theme with ruby gem method, you have to do some extra jobs**.

With gem-based themes, some of the site’s directories (such as the *assets*, *_layouts*, *_includes* and *_sass* directories) are stored in the theme’s gem, hidden from your immediate view. You need add some files in your Jekyll site directory:

```bash
├── 404.html
├── Gemfile
├── _config.yml
├── _data
│   └── locale.yml
├── _posts
│   └── ...
├── about.md
├── archive.html
└── index.html
```

You can refer to the [/test folder](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme/tree/master/test), this is a example with gem-based themes.

## Local Preview

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the development server, then you can visit [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) to preview your site.

## Build and Publish

If you host your site on GitHub Pages, just push the source to the master branch of your USERNAME.github.io repository, GitHub would build automatically. You can visit your site on **https://USERNAME.github.io** several minutes later.

If you host your site on your server, you need first run `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build` to generated your site, then update the files in *_site* folder to your server.
